Adjustment Made Easy: A Look Into Clustering Seemingly Unrelated Census Data
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Our work was done in collaboration with Dr. James Livsey of the U.S. Census Bureau. We took time series data released from the Economic Directorate to analyze
correlations between differing industries. Using these newly-found correlations, we were able to make suggestions to analysts on which series should be jointly modeled.
This was done with the intention of adjusting data in a multivariate manner, as opposed to the univariate way that data is analyzed nowâ€” such as seasonally adjusted data
around holiday time each year. Examining in a multivariate fashion allows better approximations for data, as well as takes other trends into account to relate industries
to one another.
