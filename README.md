Adjustments Made Easy: A Look at Clustering Time Series from the US Census Bureau Manufacturersâ€™ Shipments, Inventories, and Orders
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Our work was done in collaboration with Dr. James Livsey of the U.S. Census Bureau. We took time series data released from the Economic Directorate to analyze correlations between differing industries. Using correlations between series, we made suggestions on which series could be jointly modeled. This was done with the intention of selecting candidate series for multivariate seasonal adjustment, as opposed to the univariate way that data is adjusted now. Examining in a multivariate fashion allows better approximations for data, as well as takes other dynamics into account to relate industries to one another. The results outlined in this paper provide thirteen suggested clusters using dynamic time warping methodology that the Economic Directorate can utilize.
